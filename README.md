Features
Asynchronous Operations: Leverage the power of Tokio for high-performance async programming.
CRUD Functionality: Easily create, read, update, and delete items through well-defined API endpoints.
SQLite Integration: Use SQLite for lightweight, serverless database management.
Structured Responses: Responses are serialized to JSON for easy consumption by clients.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling ensures a robust API experience.
Well-Documented: Each function and endpoint is documented for clarity and ease of understanding.
